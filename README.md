## Framework for Suicide Ideation Detection
This repository contains a comprehensive framework for detecting suicide ideation using deep learning and machine learning techniques. The framework consists of several stages, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. To get started, follow these steps:
## Install dependencies: 
  Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and the CountVectorizer library.
## Prepare your dataset: 
  Prepare your dataset containing the text data for analysis. The dataset should be in a suitable format, such as a CSV file.
## Run the framework: 
  Execute the framework.py file, which will guide you through the stages of data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification.
## Evaluate the results: 
  After running the framework, you will obtain the results of the classification process. Analyze the performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework.
Customize the model: You can customize the framework by adjusting the hyperparameters, selecting different classifiers, or incorporating additional features to improve the performance of the model.
By following these steps, you can successfully use the provided framework to detect suicide ideation using deep learning and machine learning techniques. The framework is designed to be flexible, allowing you to easily adapt it to your specific needs and dataset.
